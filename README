This project is mainly designed as a format library for our
serial and distributed projects that involve RIVER: Cardinal[1] and simpletracer[2].

If you want to use it outside these projects, follow the following
instructions:

In order to build and install the river.format library,
integrate it into the cmake project that will use the library
following the below guideline.

In the root CMakeLists.txt file, before the line
that builds your executables / libraries, add the
following lines:
add_subdirectory(river.format/logger)
add_subdirectory(river.format/format.handler)

These will build two static libraries,
liblogger.a and libformat.handler.a. In order to link
these objects you need to use:
target_link_libraries(TARGET logger format.handler)
